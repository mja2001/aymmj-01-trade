## ðŸš€ Overview
This repository provides a robust foundation for developing trading bots, algorithmic strategies, portfolio managers, and market analysis tools. It emphasizes:
- **Modular architecture** tailored for financial data processing, strategy implementation, and execution engines.
- **Scalable CI/CD pipelines** with automated backtesting and performance benchmarking.
- **Collaboration guidelines** with templates for reproducible experiments and strategy reviews.
- **Pre-built integrations** for popular trading APIs (e.g., Alpaca, Interactive Brokers) and data providers (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
- **Security hardening** for handling sensitive API keys and financial data.

Whether you're building a simple momentum trader or a complex multi-asset portfolio optimizer, this template accelerates your path to production.
